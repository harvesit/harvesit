# üî≠ Vision
Harvesit aims to transform local food systems by bringing community members together around fresh, sustainably grown produce. Our platform connects residents directly with area growers - from traditional farmers to backyard gardeners - facilitating commerce and mutual understanding. By making small-scale agriculture economically viable and letting individuals play an active role in their food supply, Harvesit strives to help towns achieve self-sufficiency and environmental resilience.  

We are working to build community resilience and self-reliance from the ground up, starting with food. As people grow closer to their food sources, Harvesit also lets them grow closer to nature and more connected with others doing the same. Our platform shortens the distance between growers and consumers both physically and relationally. This helps create local economies that promote transparency and trust. Integrating the latest technology with traditional growing methods, Harvesit serves as a model for balancing innovation with ecological limits.

If we can transform how towns are fed, we can transform our society. By combining an ethos of community interdependence with tools for independence from global systems, Harvesit aims to write a new chapter for thriving localised economies.

# üå± Harvesit App
Harvesit, which works similarly to DoorDash and Airbnb, seeks to revolutionise local food supply chains and agriculture through its innovative digital platform.

It connects growers, consumers, and delivery providers in a community-centric ecosystem. Growers can sell or trade their produce, benefiting from Smartphone, AI and IoT technologies for enhanced crop management. Consumers enjoy access to fresh, local produce with the option to buy or trade, fostering a sustainable local food economy. Harvesit stands out for its integration of advanced technology with traditional farming practices, promoting sustainability, community engagement, and economic independence at a local level.
